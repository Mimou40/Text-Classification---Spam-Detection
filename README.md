Spam Detection with Naive Bayes

This repository contains a simple yet effective spam detection model built using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The model is trained on a dataset of spam and non-spam emails to classify new emails with high accuracy.

Features

Text Classification:
Utilizes the power of machine learning to categorize emails as either spam or legitimate (not spam).

Naive Bayes Algorithm:
A probabilistic model known for its simplicity and efficiency in text classification tasks.

Data Preprocessing:
Includes steps like text vectorization using CountVectorizer to prepare emails for model training.

Model Evaluation:
Provides insights into model performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.

Prediction: Demonstrates how to use the trained model to classify new emails.
